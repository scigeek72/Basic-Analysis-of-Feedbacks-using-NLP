# Basic-Analysis-of-Feedbacks-using-NLP
This notebook contains a basic analysis of some tagged feedbacks borrowing techniques from NLP. Each feedback can have multiple tags. The goal is to tag a new feedback. 

The associated notebook contains a preliminary analysis. I plan to come up with a more advanced analysis soon.
